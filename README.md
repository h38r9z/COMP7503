Programming Assignment
Deadline: Nov 29 2024, before   11:55pm
Preamble:This assignment is composed of   two parts: a) Programming Part,   and   b)   Written   Part. The   purpose of   this assignment    is   to   get   you familiar   with   the concepts of   multimedia   systems,   through   the   realization   of Smart   City   Use   Case(s).   In   essence,   you   are   required   to   acquire   appropriate   data   streams   from   https://data.gov.hk/,   and based   on these   data to   craft   up use   cases   and   derive   insights   in relation   to   smart   city   initiatives.   There   is no   fixed   scope   nor limit for the smart city use   cases,   you   are   free   to   choose   appropriate   use   cases   as   you   see   fit.The programming part requires you to implement an application that   fetch   data   streams   from   https://data.gov.hk/,   data   analysis and   correlation, as well as   dashboards   to present   insights   in relation to your selected smart   city use   cases.   The written part,   on   the   other   hand,   requires   you to write a report, in which you explain in details your smart city use cases, and   corresponding implementation details.
Please   note   that   this   is   a   group   programming   assignment.   We   expect   two   or   three
students working together to complete this assignment.
Overview:To fulfill the programming part, you are required to conduct your programming   tasks   in the Node-RED   environment.   Please   follow the Docker-based   setup   instructions to   launch   a    Docker container for your programming environment. After successful launch, your   Docker container will be configured with a Node-RED programming environment   as well   as   a MongoDB instance for data   storage.Node-RED   is   a   programming   tool   for   wiring   together   hardware   devices,   APIs   and   online   services in new   and interesting ways. It provides   a   browser-based   editor   that   makes   it   easy to wire together flows using the wide range   of   nodes   in the palette   that   can   be   deployed to   its runtime   in   a   single-click.

A built-in library allows you to save    useful      functions,   templates or flows   for re-use.An example has been provided in the   file   HKO.Flow.json,   and   you   should   be   able   to   import it into your node-red environment as shown in Figure   1. This is essentially a   demonstration of   how to fetch temperature data from Hong Kong   Observatory,   and plots   the   historical temperature of   various Hong Kong locations up to the last 24 hours   as   illustrated in Figure   2.

Programming Part:The programming part requires you to implement an application that   fetch   data   streams   from   https://data.gov.hk/,   data   analysis and   correlation, as well as   dashboards   to present   insights   in relation to your   selected   smart   city use   cases. Be   sure   to   start   storing   data   earlier   for   your   subsequent   work   as   it   takes   time   to   accumulate   enough   data   for   your   smart   city   use   cases development.
Written Part:You   are required to write   a report, in which   you   explain   in   details   your   smart   city   use   cases,   and   corresponding   implementation   details,   data storing approach, and    explain   how each   dashboard present the corresponding smart city use case insights.
Assignment Submission:
Assignment must be submitted through the moodle course web. The following   files   have to be submitted as   a   one   single zip   file:
1. Exported flow file in your node-red environment.
2. The docker ID from docker hub or   docker   description   file.
3. Project report
Important Notes:
1.          Late submission is subjected to the penalty of   5% deduction per   day.
2.          Submission late for more than one week will not be entertained.
3.         Programs that cannot be compiled will NOT be graded.
4.         Plagiarism will be heavily penalized.
